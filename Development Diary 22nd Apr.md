On the final stretch, the hand in is tomorrow.

- Firstly I gave up with my AI, I just could not get it to work, it can still find the player but refuses to move.
- I have a title screen which is a little buggy due to the graphics framework on monogame being a little strange, on some computers it just doesn't want to fit the read resolution.
- There is a sprite around the player which follow him and restricts the view for the player
- The game has an objective all beit a simple one, collect all three gems on the level to win.
- I didn't bother redoing the Pathfinder files from AI as I already understand it and would be a waste of time.

I think that's all I am going to implement before the hand in but hey ho. Wish I had spent more time on it before now as I really enjoyed making it and I feel like I could of added so much more.

I'm going to try and work on it more over the summer.
