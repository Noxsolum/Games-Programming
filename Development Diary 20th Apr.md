Finally got some real work done. 

- I have got my textures changes so and have some background music implemented.
- My AI is still as useless as ever, it knows where the player is but doesn't move towards him.
- The Maze Generator is fully functioning at 30 * 30 maze which I think is fine.
- Lastly I have a camera that follows the player.

Made some headway over the last week and I am quite proud of it so far.
