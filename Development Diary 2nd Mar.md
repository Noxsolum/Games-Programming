# Games-Programming
I have finally gotten started on my game, it's not the most complex game in terms of features but it requires two heavy coding features
Features to implement:
- Player Movement.
- Fake Maze (till I can get the maze generator working).
- A* AI program so enemy's can move towards the player.
- 2D scene.
- Sound is a key part, since this is a kind of horror game, it has to have atmosphere.
- A zoomed camera, so you only see part of the maze.

Thing's I am thing thinking about:
- Having some kind of objective, e.g. making the player collect something instead of just going from point A to point B.
- Better graphics (Going for very simple graphics at the moment).
