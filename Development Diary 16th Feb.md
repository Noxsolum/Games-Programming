# Games-Programming

Over the last week I have been thinking about my idea a lot and have still been slightly indisisive, I have my two ideas:
- The first being a side scrolling space shooter
- The second being a Maze survival game with AI

I have decided to work on both depending how each go, if I find myself serviely getting stuck on the second idea I will revert to the other.
