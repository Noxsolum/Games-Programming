## Development Diary - 02/02/2015

Just started thinking about my project and I have a few ideas
- Going to either use Unreal Engine 4 or Monogame to create my game, hoping to use Unreal as I want to use C++ to code with.
- Undecided whether to do a 3D or 2D game
- For a 3D game I was hoping to make a sort of survival maze game but creating a maze generator seems to be rather difficult and may be better for the third year.
- As for a 2D game, I would have a sidescroller that relies on random gameplay mechanics and to build around that.
