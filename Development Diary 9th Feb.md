# Games-Programming
## Development Diary - 09/02/2015

- My major change this week is that I will be making a 2D rather than a 3D game as it seems more achievable for me.
- I have also decided to stick to monogame as I will lose marks for Unreal Engine due to giving me too much and I would like to write my own physics.
- My game idea is pretty simple but I can build upon it fairly easily.

-My Idea
-- Space shooter, side scrolling
-- Infinite scrolling until death
-- Accumalative scoring, purchasable upgrades
-- Etc ...
-- Not too sure about any kind or story yet but I will be thinking about it over the coming week
